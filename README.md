# fxForward
A currency forward or FX forward contract is an agreement that allows the buyer to lock in an exchange rate the day on which the agreement is signed for a transaction that will be completed later. Forward contracts are one of the main methods used to hedge against exchange rate volatility, as they avoid the impact of currency fluctuation over the period covered by the contract.
